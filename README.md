# PolygonDrawer
This program was created for a class. The problem was to create an ArrayList of Point2D.Double objects (to simulate each coordinate of a polygon) which is populated by the user, then produce its perimeter and area. 

To explore the graphics engine in Java's awt libraries, I decided to then draw the polygon on a JPanel as part of extra credit.
